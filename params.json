{"name":"TFS Kanban buddy","tagline":"Powerfull Kanban enhancement for Microsoft Team Foundation Server","body":"###Welcome to TFS Kanban Buddy\r\nThis is a Chrome Extension that adds some pretty powerful features to TFS around the Task and Backlog/Kanban boards without the need to change anything in tfs itself all the functionality is client side. This started out as crude Userscripts and has over time grown into a full fledged configurable Chrome extension. As of 2015-05-08 we have 280 users most in the mother organisation where development originated but about 100 users are outside.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Configurable coloring of TFS Tickets on Kanban board and Task board.\r\n* Filtering by category of tickets on the Kanban board based on naming convention\r\n* Freetext Filtering of tickets on the Kanban Board\r\n* Highlighting of related tickets based on naming convention.\r\n* Highlighting dates in titles\r\n* Custom configurable Links in TFS to make n navigation easier.\r\n* Share configuration for the whole team.\r\n* Automatic Board data collecion.\r\n* CFD based on collected data\r\n* Cycle time calculation based on collected data.\r\n* Flow report showing when Tickets has been in a certain lane\r\n* Flow data grid showing total duration in different states\r\n* Snapshot show in the current state of the tickets and for how long time it has been in the current state\r\n\r\n Current version works with TFS 2013 on premise and TFS online.\r\n \r\n There is an older version available that works with TFS 2012.\r\n \r\n### Card Colors\r\n\r\n1. Here we have 3 tickets with titles starting with `CR` `MA`and `BUG` ![3 plain tickets](images/3plainTickets.png)\r\n2. Open the config Page ![](images/icon.png)\r\n3. Enter `CR` `MA`and `BUG` on one color each (adding two prefixes separated with ; `Bug;BUG` enables two prefixes to give the same color ![](images/colorConfig.png)\r\n4. Go to the board again and refresh and the tickets will be colored ![](images/3coloredTickets.png) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
